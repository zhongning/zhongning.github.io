## Description

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Code:**

```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        
    }
}
```
